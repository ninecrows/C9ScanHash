# C9ScanHash
A simple directory tree duplicate file finder. Intended to hash everything in the folder tree and show duplicate files that are found.

This is intended to walk a folder tree, generate hashes of the contents of each file and report the duplicates within that tree.

Later functionality may extend to cleaning out selected duplicates and assisting with archiving of the tree with deduplication.
